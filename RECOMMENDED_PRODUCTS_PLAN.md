# Recommended Products Feature - Implementation Plan

## üìã **Current State Overview**

### **Existing Application**
- **Name**: Data Science UI Mockup Tool (Grocery Store Data Explorer)
- **Framework**: Streamlit with interactive hierarchy navigation
- **Data Structure**: 4-level hierarchy (Departments ‚Üí Categories ‚Üí Subcategories ‚Üí Products)
- **Key Features**:
  - Documentation and architecture overview
  - Interactive data explorer with hierarchical filtering
  - Tree hierarchy with multi-level selection using `streamlit-tree-select`
  - Quality evolution charts with temporal analysis
  - CSV-based data storage (no database required)

### **Current Data Files**
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ departments.csv      # 8 departments (Fresh Foods, Packaged Goods, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories.csv       # 24 categories (Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subcategories.csv    # 72 subcategories (Citrus Fruits, Leafy Greens, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products.csv         # 500+ individual products with pricing/inventory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ temporal_quality.csv # Quality tracking over time periods
```

## üéØ **Use Case & Requirements**

### **Business Problem**
- **Weekly Recommendations**: New grocery items are automatically suggested for the store
- **Manual Approval Process**: Recommendations should not auto-add to the live hierarchy
- **Batch Review Workflow**: Managers review recommendations every few months (not weekly)
- **Contextual Placement**: Users need to see where recommended items would appear in the hierarchy
- **Bulk Operations**: Ability to approve/reject multiple items efficiently

### **Core Requirements**
1. **Visual Integration**: Recommended products appear in-place within the hierarchy with visual indicators
2. **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide recommended products as needed
3. **Approval Actions**: Individual and bulk approve/reject capabilities
4. **Contextual Review**: See products in their suggested hierarchy positions
5. **Audit Trail**: Track approval decisions and review history
6. **Data Persistence**: Maintain approval states between sessions

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Design Philosophy**
- **In-Place Approval**: Recommended products are pre-placed in hierarchy with visual flags
- **Minimal UI Disruption**: Enhance existing tree interface rather than creating new workflows
- **Keep/Remove Decision**: Users decide whether to keep auto-placed recommendations
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status badges for different product states

### **Recommended Architecture**
- **Enhanced Tree View**: Extend current `streamlit-tree-select` with status indicators
- **Status-Based Filtering**: Dynamic show/hide based on product approval state
- **CSV-Based State Management**: Add status columns to existing product data
- **Session State Tracking**: Maintain UI state for review sessions

---

## üìä **Data Architecture Changes**

### **Enhanced Product Schema**
```python
# products.csv - Additional Columns:
- status: 'approved' | 'recommended' | 'rejected'  # Product approval state
- recommendation_date: datetime                     # When item was suggested
- reviewed_by: string                              # Who made the approval decision
- review_date: datetime                            # When decision was made
- recommendation_source: string                    # Source of recommendation (AI, manual, etc.)
```

### **New Data Files**
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approved_hierarchy/          # Current production data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ departments.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subcategories.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ products.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow_tracking/          # Audit trail
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approval_history.csv    # Complete approval history
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ review_sessions.csv     # Manager review session tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ temporal_quality.csv       # Existing quality data
```

### **Approval History Schema**
```python
# approval_history.csv:
- product_id: int
- product_name: string
- action: 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'deferred'
- previous_status: string
- new_status: string
- reviewed_by: string
- review_date: datetime
- hierarchy_path: string  # "Department > Category > Subcategory"
```

## üé® **UI/UX Design Approach**

### **Visual Status Indicators**
```python
# Tree Node Labels with Status:
"üîç New Product Name (RECOMMENDED)"     # Pending recommendation
"‚úÖ Approved Product Name"              # Approved for live hierarchy  
"‚ùå Rejected Product Name"              # Rejected (if showing rejected items)
"üì¶ Regular Product Name"               # Existing approved products
```

### **Filter Controls (Sidebar)**
```python
# User Controls:
show_recommended = st.checkbox("Show Recommended Products", value=True)
show_rejected = st.checkbox("Show Rejected Products", value=False)  
show_approved_only = st.checkbox("Show Only Approved Products", value=False)
review_mode = st.selectbox("Review Mode", ["All", "This Week", "This Month"])
```

### **Bulk Operations Interface**
```python
# Below Tree Selection:
if selected_recommended_products:
    st.subheader("üìã Review Selected Products")
    
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
    with col1:
        st.button("‚úÖ Approve Selected ({count})")
    with col2:
        st.button("‚ùå Reject Selected ({count})")
    with col3:
        st.button("‚è≠Ô∏è Review Later")
```
