# Recommended Products Feature - Implementation Plan

## üìã **Current State Overview**

### **Existing Application**
- **Name**: Data Science UI Mockup Tool (Grocery Store Data Explorer)
- **Framework**: Streamlit with interactive hierarchy navigation
- **Data Structure**: 4-level hierarchy (Departments ‚Üí Categories ‚Üí Subcategories ‚Üí Products)
- **Key Features**:
  - Documentation and architecture overview
  - Interactive data explorer with hierarchical filtering
  - Tree hierarchy with multi-level selection using `streamlit-tree-select`
  - Quality evolution charts with temporal analysis
  - CSV-based data storage (no database required)

### **Current Data Files**
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ departments.csv      # 8 departments (Fresh Foods, Packaged Goods, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories.csv       # 24 categories (Fruits, Vegetables, Dairy, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subcategories.csv    # 72 subcategories (Citrus Fruits, Leafy Greens, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ products.csv         # 500+ individual products with pricing/inventory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ temporal_quality.csv # Quality tracking over time periods
```

## üéØ **Use Case & Requirements**

### **Business Problem**
- **Weekly Recommendations**: New grocery items are automatically suggested for the store
- **Manual Approval Process**: Recommendations should not auto-add to the live hierarchy
- **Batch Review Workflow**: Managers review recommendations every few months (not weekly)
- **Contextual Placement**: Users need to see where recommended items would appear in the hierarchy
- **Bulk Operations**: Ability to approve/reject multiple items efficiently

### **Approval Workflow Overview**

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#ffebee
    style H fill:#f3e5f5
```

### **Core Requirements**
1. **Visual Integration**: Recommended products appear in-place within the hierarchy with visual indicators
2. **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide recommended products as needed
3. **Approval Actions**: Individual and bulk approve/reject capabilities
4. **Contextual Review**: See products in their suggested hierarchy positions
5. **Complete Audit Trail**: Comprehensive history of all approval/rejection decisions with timestamps, user attribution, and reasoning
6. **Data Persistence**: Maintain approval states between sessions
7. **Historical Analytics**: Track approval patterns, decision timelines, and recommendation accuracy over time

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Approach**

### **Design Philosophy**
- **In-Place Approval**: Recommended products are pre-placed in hierarchy with visual flags
- **Minimal UI Disruption**: Enhance existing tree interface rather than creating new workflows
- **Keep/Remove Decision**: Users decide whether to keep auto-placed recommendations
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status badges for different product states

### **Recommended Architecture**
- **Enhanced Tree View**: Extend current `streamlit-tree-select` with status indicators
- **Status-Based Filtering**: Dynamic show/hide based on product approval state
- **CSV-Based State Management**: Add status columns to existing product data
- **Session State Tracking**: Maintain UI state for review sessions

---

## üìä **Data Architecture Changes**

### **Enhanced Product Schema**
